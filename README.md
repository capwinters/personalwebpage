# Making of this site

I designed and developed this site more or less from scratch. I must admit that
most of the stuff I learned while doing, so code is not very neat, nevertheless
if anyone wants to modify and use it as a template, here is the repo.

I tried to stick to a front and design in the form of a traditional resume.
I guess every engineer with more than 10 years of experience, usually struggle
while trying to keep it short but also mention everything important to tell to
a potential employer.

I took on this challenge and [d3](https://d3js.org/) was the first stop.
If you are viewing desktop version of this page, you can use bubbles to highlight
related words for a specific field. Pretty much like an employer prints and
highlights the points he/she wants to talk about.

Anyways, I guess no one has time to read a boring story of how a web page
is created, so I will keep it short.

Here are the references to everything I used:

* [Pingendo](https://pingendo.com/) ( a very user friendly [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) designer)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) and its default markdown preview package
* [d3]() web page
* actual bubble chart i was inspired from [NY Times](https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/09/06/us/politics/convention-word-counts.html)
* Jim Vallandingham's [tutorial](http://vallandingham.me/bubble_cloud/)
_( for hobby web designer like me, whose programming reflexes go down to
C and all its strictness, even javascript is like walking naked outside, let alone [coffescript](https://coffeescript.org/). For me it was too much pain, so i converted it to javascript and I must admit
it is not very readable. I guess he has a pure javascript version now)_
* several pieces of javascript I forgot where I found from
