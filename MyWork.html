                                        <p class="lead text-justify">I am working on a source independent framework to define the standard
                                            ways of using crowd sourcing data for network quality analysis and optimisation.&nbsp;</p>
                                        
                                    <img src="img\CrowdSourcing2.jpg" class="img-responsive"><p class="text-justify">
                                        <br>There was no way that big data will not meet field quality measurement.
                                        It is finally here and one of the many faces is coming under the general
                                        name of crowd-sourcing.&nbsp;
                                        <br>
                                        <br>My first experience with crowd-sourcing for field quality measurement
                                        and reporting purposes was with very simple OOKLA® SpeedTest results. It
                                        did not take too long after this encounter, that I realized the potential
                                        of smart (especially Android) phones.&nbsp;
                                        <br>Meanwhile, same awareness was growing in many different companies around
                                        the world. Since then these companies like&nbsp;Ookla, OpenSignal, Tutela
                                        have evolved and many others are joining them.&nbsp;
                                        <br>
                                        <br>However, I still see a gap between those companies who collect the data
                                        and mobile network industry. This is because these companies are usually
                                        application and/or SDK developers and lack the mobile network engineering
                                        point of view while processing their data. For example, even the android
                                        developer reference is not very clear on distinguishing different RATs
                                        and network quality parameters under each and every one of them. Different
                                        implementations of different OSs (again especially Android) are adding
                                        to this chaos by not reporting and/or reporting fixed, therefore false,
                                        values.&nbsp;This is however not a difficult obstacle, it is basically
                                        a standard step of data cleaning&nbsp;in data-mining… and it is fun! &nbsp;
                                        <br>
                                        <br>All in all, like many other data-mining tasks, provided that the critical
                                        level of “statistically meaningfulness” is passed, there is an endless
                                        potential in extracting valuable information from what smart phones can
                                        record. My most recent work is exactly in this area and it excites me more
                                        than any task to witness this revolution from the first seat.</p>
